# blackjack

## TODO
- show settings / strategy command
- split strategy for 8-8s is different
- fill out basic strategy charts / check them
- use Logging typeclass for logging / debug flags
- should have already checked for blackjack error? uncomment the TODOs I think
- get rid of the IO ref for tracking repl state
- tests
